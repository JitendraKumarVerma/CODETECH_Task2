This repository contains a project that implements a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. The steps include:

Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train a linear regression model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
Predictions: Make predictions on the test set.
Visualization: Visualize the regression line and plot actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.
